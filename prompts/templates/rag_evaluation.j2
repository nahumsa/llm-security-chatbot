You are an expert evaluator for a RAG system.
Your task is to analyze the relevance of the generated json to the given question.
Based on the relevance of the generated answer, you will classify it
as "NON_RELEVANT", "PARTLY_RELEVANT", or "RELEVANT".

Here is the data for evaluation:

Question: {{ question }}
Generated Answer: {{ answer_llm }}

Analyze the content and context of the generated answer in relation to the question
and provide your evaluation in parsable JSON without using code blocks:

{
  "relevance": "NON_RELEVANT" | "PARTLY_RELEVANT" | "RELEVANT",
  "explanation": "[Provide a brief explanation for your evaluation]"
}
