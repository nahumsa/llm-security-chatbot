Welcome to the Chatbot with OWASP Top 10 for LLMs Applications project! This repository hosts a chatbot designed with security in mind, utilizing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to provide accurate and secure information based on the OWASP Top 10 security practices for Large Language Models (LLMs).
